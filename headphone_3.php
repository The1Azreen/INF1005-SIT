                <p>The HiFiMan Sundara 2020, an upgrade from the 2018 model, features open-back, planar magnetic design for a neutral sound profile.
                    With redesigned ear cup padding for added comfort, these audiophile headphones are ideal for home listening, despite their bulky frame and lack of portability.
                    With a 32 ohm impedance and 94dB sensitivity, they're compatible with mobile devices, but an amp is recommended for optimal performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Technical Description:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hi-tech diaphragm: Diaphragm is 80% thinner than previous series, resulting in more detail, faster transients and an extended frequency response.</li>
                    <li>New headband design: Offers separate head strap which allows for the headphone weight to be spread perfectly evenly over the wearer's head. It delivers both a more comfortable fit but also a more eye-pleasing look.</li>
                    <li>All-new Headband: Street-friendly, and built to take the wear and tear of everyday life while looking great as it does it.</li>
                    <li>Connectivity: Headphone cable attachment uses the standard 3.5mm socket, a physically robust connector.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="price">$299.00</h3>
